-- Fix the remaining GUC-based storage policies (school-gallery, school-assets).
--
-- Same root cause as migration 51: Supabase Storage is a separate service that
-- does NOT run PostgREST's db-pre-request hook (scope_pre_request), so
-- app.school_id / app.role are never set and get_my_role() returns NULL on
-- storage requests. The gallery/asset upload+delete policies relied on
-- get_my_role(), so every admin upload failed with an RLS 403.
--
-- Rewrite them to authorize directly from auth.uid() against user_roles (the
-- same self-contained approach migration 51 used for homework attachments).
-- Behavior is preserved: these are role-only checks (no path/school scoping in
-- the originals), so any active super_admin / school_admin / principal role
-- (global super_admin with school_id IS NULL, or a per-school admin/principal)
-- may write. Both buckets remain public-read (unchanged).
